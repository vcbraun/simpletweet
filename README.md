# Project 2 - *SimpleTweet*

**SimpleTweet** is an android app that allows a user to view their Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

## User Stories

  - [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  - [x] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter
  - [x] User is taken back to home timeline with **new tweet visible** in timeline
  - [x] Newly created tweet should be manually inserted into the timeline and not rely on a full refresh

- [x] User can **pull down to refresh tweets timeline**
- [x] User is using **"Twitter branded" colors and styles**

- [x] Uses Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.org/android/Using-Parceler).
